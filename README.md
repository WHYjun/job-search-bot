# job-search-bot
 
A python script to notify users if new job posted on a daily basis.

## Installation

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that you should install to run `Job Search Bot`. You can install required libraries by using:

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have pip yet, please install 'pip' from the following link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

## Future Works

- Add the functionality to send a text message or email to user.
- Notify users if and only if the company posts a new job posting, not remove old job postings.
